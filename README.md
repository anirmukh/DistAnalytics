# DistAnalytics


INTRODUCTION

Distribution-based analytics is a process whereby sales results are adjusted according to the distribution levels of the particular groups being analyzed. Distributors have embraced the value of data analytics in their operations, using visualization software and machine learning to inform business partners. It allows the companies to describe and predict their business environment with information that can be easily used and understood.

LAYERS OF DISTRIBUTION ANALYTICS
LEVEL 0: Data
	Distributors collects and stores data in workstations, relational databases, and enterprise data warehouses. Analytics involves analyzing the data and getting to know what’s happening and why.
LEVEL 1: Data Analysis
	This refers to reporting the data. For an instance, how many products were sold last month, or the month before that? What was the total sales revenue generated last month?
LEVEL 2: Predictive Data Analysis
	By using newly developed predictive analytics, decision maker can look into the future. It analyzes currents data to make predictions about unknown future events.

BENEFITS OF DISTRIBUTION ANALYTICS
•	Increasing Customer Experience
It can help us keep the customers satisfied by increasing delivery speed and product availability.
•	Healthy ROI
By using distribution-based and predictive analytics, one can experience a higher ROI in a much shorter time-frame.
•	Fast Insights into overall sales trend
With proper charts, there’s a very clear view of the sales count, sales volume and other parameters based on regions and further drill downs. 


MODULES
Dashboard:
Dashboard provides at-a-glance views of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) relative to the business process. The dashboard here provides at-a-glance view of KPIs namely, Sales Count, Sales Volume, Point of Sales (POS) and Customer Experience (CEX) based on the present month. The dashboard is linked to the database and is constantly updated.
It helps the manager to monitor the performance and align strategies and organizational goals. It also saves time compared to running multiple reports. The benefits also includes the ability to identify and correct negative trends.

Different KPIs:
1.	Sales Count:
As per the user choice of month and year, the total sales count is displayed for that particular month and year grouped by items.
On selecting a particular item, the region wise sales count is displayed which further drills down to area and then distributor wise.
2.	Sales Volume:
As per the user choice of month and year, the total sales volume is displayed for that particular month and year grouped by items.
On selecting a particular item, the region wise sales volume is displayed which further drills down to area and then distributor wise.



3.	POS Count:
Point of Sales (POS) is the time and place where a retail transaction is completed. Businesses are increasingly adopting POS systems and one of the most obvious and compelling reasons is that a POS system does away with the need for price tags. Selling prices are linked to the product code of an item when adding stock, so the cashier merely needs to scan this code to process a sale. If there is a price change, this can also be easily done through the inventory window. Other advantages include ability to implement various types of discounts, a loyalty scheme for customers and more efficient stock control. 
As per the user choice of month and year, the total POS is displayed for that particular month and year grouped by items.
On selecting a particular item, the region wise POS is displayed which further drills down to area and then distributor wise.


4.	Customer Experience (CEX):
The entirety of the interaction a customer has with a company and its products. Understanding the Customer Experience (CEX) is an integral part of customer relationship management. The overall experience reflects how the customer feels about the company and its offerings. Surveys, feedback forms and other data collection techniques help a company to determine the customer experience.

5.	Unit Activation/ Recharging Outlets:
The total number of Unit Activations and Recharging Outlets is displayed grouped by Region of the present and last two months.

6.	Primary/ Secondary Recharges:

8.	SAF:
The total amount of SAF collected is displayed region wise for the present and the last two months.
9.	Sim Activation:
The total number of Sim Activation is displayed region wise for the present and last two months.


Predictive Analytics:
1.	Forecasting (HW):
Holt Winters method also known as Triple Exponential Smoothing, can be used to forecast data points in a series, provided that the series is ‘seasonal’, i.e. repetitive over some period.
On selection of category, date to forecast from, date to forecast till, forecasting type (daily, weekly, or monthly) and the forecasting period, the forecasting for the required span is displayed along with a plot from R.
2.	Cluster Analysis:
Clustering Analysis is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It is a discovery tool that reveals associations, patterns, relationships, and structures in masses of data.
On selection of category, date to do analysis from, date to do analysis till, and the region (user can also select ALL), the plot of cluster analysis from R is displayed on screen.
